# About Pagoda

The goal of Pagoda is to be a procedural modelling framework aimed at
supporting researchers and academics in this field. Therefore, it must be
flexible enough to allow the implementation of multiple algorithms and
methodologies.

Currently, Pagoda implements a graph-based approach since it is considered to
be one of the most flexible methods to specify the rules in procedural
modelling. The idea is to, eventually, reach a design that allows its users to
re-use code from any of the available layers to implement other methodologies.
