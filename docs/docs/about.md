# About Selector

The goal of Selector is to be a procedural modelling framework aimed at supporting researchers and academics in this field. Therefore, it must be flexible enough to allow the implementation of multiple algorithms and methodologies.

Currently, Selector implements a graph-based approach since it is considered to be one of the most flexible methods to specify the rules in procedural modelling. The idea is to, eventually, reach a design that allows its users to re-use code from any of the available layers to implement other methodologies.
